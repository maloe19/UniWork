Abstract
	Denne report handler om at visualiserer noget spatel data fra sdu industry 4.0 i et internet of things(IoT) miljø, 
	med fokus på user-centered development og design(UCD) via human-robot interaction (HRI). 
	Reporten prøver at opnå en undersøgelse for påvirkningn af UCD på HRI kan gavne valg og 
	hvad og hvordan data visualisering kan bringe på bordet af fordele og hvilke ulemper der
	kan være.
	Der vil blive brugt matplotlib som visualiserings værktøj til at få ønskede resultater og 
	UCD metoden brugerevaluering for at få det user-centered aspekt med i projektet.
	Udover overstående vil der også kommes ind på human-in-the-loop(HITL) og internet of behavior(IoB).
Introduction
	Effectiveness is always something that is strives for, especially because it can save both money and time, 
	in this report the situation is to design a interface that visualize robot collected data to get a better understanding. 
	The goal of the report is to improve the data quality displayed on a screen for humans to make more sufficient desicions.
	All this in collaboration the UCD methods like survyes and interview, to get a proper project that is best suited to the people, 
	who have given the data, and maybe will use the interface made by the student for this project. In this project interviews 
	will be used to get the desired requirements.

	About dataVis, it is data illustrated with e.g graphs. When illustrating data, it can be done in a static and or dynamic(/interactive) way. 
	The static way is just specific chosen data illustrated, while dynamic(/interactive) is the same at basis, but with dynamic(/interactive)
	it can be manipulated by something like sorting. What dataVis is used for and good at is human decision making, since human react better
	to visuals(a picture says more than a 1000 words).
	What this report and the whole report try to accomplish is in short visualization of some data with specified aspects like making decisions
	in IoT environments. The following questions will contribute to that course.
		How to visualize the given data in such a way it helps decision makers? 
		How to incorporate user-centered design in this project? 
		What are the advantages and disadvantages of data visualization?	
	How the student will solve the problem and find a preferable solution is by using a tool found in the tool selection(literature) for the visualization part
	and with a UCD user evaluation to guide the visualization.

	IoT is physical things like sensors that can communicate over networks or the internet, and thereby connect to systems and or devices. In this case 
	the physicals things are sensors that are attached to a robot, the sensors will thereso collect some data which will be transfered over a network to
	a system, which the student will design to visualize this data.
	IoB is related to IoT, but are different because it lean more into the behavior side of things, by that it means the human/users behavior towards the
	technology and the data that comes out of it.
	HRI is the study of how humans and robots interact between each other, it has root in HCI(human computer interaction) where it have got some contributions from.
	The definition of HITL is model that requires interaction from a human. HITL is close and referred to as interactive simulation, which is a simulation often physical
	that includes a human operator in it.

Background
	The student of this report that has a background in software engineering will use human-robot interaction (HRI), data visualization(dataVis) 
	and internet of things(IoT) interdisciplinary to improve data visualization (interface) for human decision making with user centered design strategies. 
	Because in a IoT enviroment with human-robot interaction (HRI), the human acts like operators and have to make decisions based on what
	the robots gather of information and data, either by its action with its actuators (such as agents) or on what it detects from its sensors. 
	Example of a agent could be a robot arm that pick up item, moves them to another place and drop them off.

	Research of this topic have been made in the paper review and other litterature(e.g. books) to get a better understanding of the subject. 
	There was especially two works that stuck out of all of them, these were the paper "Connecting Human-Robot interaction and data visualization" 
	and the book "Handbook of data visualization". These 2 helped a lot in the research apartment of this report/projects to get the right knowledge.
	The book was a really good introduction to the main topic which is data visualization, with the basic, while the paper invovled HRI into the mixed, 
	which was a good way to see and be shown an example and how the two topic could associate and work together (interdisciplinary) with each other.
	Further research influence can be find mainly under the litterature section where the paper review/paper analysis have its place and some more at 
	the references section.

	This report will further expand the area of HRI and dataVis with the contribution of the UCD method, this is what this report will bring 
	of things new to the field of work. The method in use will be interview and with that try to get the dataVis more suited for the user.

	The given data comes from a technology named XOVIS, which is a person tracking technology, were SDU industry lab 4.0 have used in their robots
	to collect the certian data. The technology is based on network configuration, since a user have to manage the the sensors on a network. For the 
	hardware part, it has 2 holes where the sensors(cameras) are placed. The XOVIS technology is easy to integrate with 3rd party applications, 
	and the interaction platform with its sensors is simple to use, and the flexible architecture allows many functionalities. All this with its
	REST API(enable RESTful request and notification interaction) and PUSH API. With XOVIS the raw data from the sensor can be access and comes out
	in XML format.

	Of new things to learn there is IoT, IoB, HRI and HITL, mainly IoT and HRI since they are ones of the main topics in this project. To help learn
	these new topics, research need to be done with websites, papers and books. Papers will be focus on and the same case is for secondary topic HITL,
	for IoB which is somewhat of a tertiary topic websites will be used for its research.
Requirements
	This section will mainly be occupied be 2 tables, 1 for functionel requiurements and 1 for non-functionel requirements, 
	each table will have an ID for the requirement, an given name and a short description of the requirement, finally the requirement
	will be rated by given a letter acording to the MoSCoW method, for the sake of prioritization in case of time limitation.

	Table for funtionel and non-functionel with ID - Name - Description - MoSCoW
Analysis
	In this section the given data by SDU industry lab 4.0 for vizualization will be analysis, in that perspect it will be discuss which
	kind of data was given and how it will affect the rest of the process, there will also be shone light of other relevant aspects of the data.
Design
	The design section will be about structuring the requirements and the decision made for the visualization of the data. Which will be influenced
	by the people who gave it in the user evaluation, and what enviroment the data comes from while what situation the people need the visualization for.
Implementation
	Implementation is the section where the execution of the code of the visualization will be showcased, with all the consideration 
	that was in the process of making it. All this with the usage of the chosen technology, that were pick out in the tool selection in the literature section above.
Test
	The section of test will show the trials the interface have gone through to check the performance of the implementation of the visualization. 
	2 kinds of tests will be used, usability test, where a user will try the interface, review it and give feedback and code-based test with 2 types 
	unit-test with JUnit and acceptance test which is behavior driven.
Reflection
	Reflection section, here there will be reflected on what to do futher beyond if given more time and how the project progress went, like pros, cons,
	what went well and what didn't go so good.
