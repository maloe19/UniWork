Position statement
    Terydyne is a corporation that supplies tools for semiconductor testing, 
    it is the worlds biggest of that kind the more than 6000 workers internatioelly
    with 1.8 bil in sales as of 2004 and is 45 year old (began in 1960, to 2005).

    The jaguar project set out to make a completely new system platform for testing
    the new product(semiconductors), therefore it is one of the most crucial project 
    in the companies history. Other than that it is a sort of culmination of the
    company try to get a more efficient product development process. A good portion 
    of the project went well, like the hardware, but some didn't like the software part.
    This also count for the management practices for development process improvement, 
    such as tools to track the progress of the team and up-front planning. Other
    challenges the project went through was team merge conflicts and deal with customer.
Evaluation Criteria
    1: Scope - task
        The first criteria for the evaluation of the jaguar project will be named scope
        and focused on how the team did in their task amount in the time that they had.
    2: Schedule - time
        The second criteria is schehule, which is time, so if the process took longer
        or shorter than deadline, and compared to the estimation of the team and company.
    3: Resources - money/cost
        Resources is the third criteria and is about how well the money was spent i.e.
        amount of team member, skill level and could some unnessesary things be spared.
    
    For scope the hardware part had all the requirements, however the software bit
    didn't, was somewhat working but with a lot of bugs.
        reason for this situation and what could they have done?
    The schedule is in the same situation as scope the hardware was on time, 
    actually early and software was late with around a year due to delays of
    bug fixing and for finished development, since they delivered like a prototype
    to the deadline.
        reason for this situation and what could they have done?
            testing
    Resources is not stated what the team got only a table of income, but it is believed
    that hardware spent the right amount or less and software definately used more budget,
    because the after work (afther the deadline) the department hired 50 people 
    additionately.(Again this is not stated directly)
        reason for this situation and what could they have done?
            affected by the other parameters/criteria
Proof of the evaluation
    1: 
        a: An advantages of scope is that it shows how big the project is, and therefore
        estimation on time and cost can be made. 
        b: A disadvantages of scope is that it can change from task to task, based on
        the goal or development.
    2:
        a: Advantages in time is that it can help with planning, and thereby allocate
        time to other projects too.
        b: Disadvantages with schehuling ia that it is always estimation, because no one
        can predict the future, and often a project is behind rather than ahead because 
        of that.
    3:
        a: An advantages with this criteria is that resources and cost can overlap easily
        and is 2/3 of the scope triangle, it is also always important to keep track of these 
        parameters, because a company need to earn money to survive, and with these profit
        can be discovered more easily.
        b: Resources disadvantages is that it is hard to decide and choose what is the right
        thing to use it on, more skills in the team, an extra team member etc.
Qualofications
    A important factor that dont get covered by the criteria is communication, well it can be 
    argued that schehule covers it a bit, but not surfficiently enough. Communication include
    meetings and team spirit, communication can be good so everyone is on the same page and 
    know what to do, but on the other hand misunderstandings can happen/accur.
    Other minor factors are stratety and structure, performance and culture, and for this
    project particually tools and process play somewhat of a vast role.

        Der kan nævnes alt det ekstra som er i bunden af casen

        Noter:
        -bunden af side 9: prototype som hjælp af alphatech udvægelse
        -tredje sidste afsnit på side 10: stres
        -lav overordnet afsnit af mening: når læst føles som om projekt ikke gik så godt og meget kaotisk(men husk på er uafaren)
